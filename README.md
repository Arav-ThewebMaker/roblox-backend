This is a roblox backend server for a small project of mine, it is like the roblox game developer donations,
what this does is basically whenever POST request called from roblox:
It is hosted on railway, it gives the user's(parameter by roblox)public games to roblox
This is useful as you cant use games API from roblox directly.
Everything was made by me :)
